## Major Problems?
I cannot run the script show_images.py without changes which are posted on ILIAS forum. 


## Helpful?
The descriptions in the TODO blocks are very precise and easy to understand. 


## Duration (hours)?

_Please make a list where every student in your group puts in the hours they used to do the complete exercise_
_Example: [5.5, 4, 7], if one of you took 5 and a half hours, one person 4 and the other 7. The order does not matter._
_This feedback will help us analyze which exercise sheets are too time-intensive._

[6, 7, 6]
