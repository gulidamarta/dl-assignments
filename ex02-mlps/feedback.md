## Major Problems?

I had major issues getting the softmax function to run, because I did not
specify the reduction axis, when taking the maximum... 
I had the same issue with the softmax function. For some reasons I thought it should be 
defined only for sum function. 

## Helpful?

The comments were helpful as always.

## Duration (hours)?

_Please make a list where every student in your group puts in the hours they used to do the complete exercise_
_Example: [5.5, 4, 7], if one of you took 5 and a half hours, one person 4 and the other 7. The order does not matter._
_This feedback will help us analyze which exercise sheets are too time-intensive._

[10, 8, 10]
