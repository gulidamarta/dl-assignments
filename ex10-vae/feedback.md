## Major Problems?
Just seems more complex in understanding than previous assignments.


## Helpful?
The descriptions in the TODO blocks are very precise and easy to understand. 


## Duration (hours)?

_Please make a list where every student in your group puts in the hours they used to do the complete exercise_
_Example: [5.5, 4, 7], if one of you took 5 and a half hours, one person 4 and the other 7. The order does not matter._
_This feedback will help us analyze which exercise sheets are too time-intensive._

[9, 9, 10]

## Other feedback?
Possibility to use Ctrl+C plus Ctrl+V to run the commands from the pdf file will be very useful.
