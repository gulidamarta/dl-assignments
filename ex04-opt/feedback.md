## Major Problems?
I had trouble understanding how to add v(1x2 vector) to the weights(2x1 vector) in the pnp task
I also had the same problem with summation. 
I experienced the same issues with the pen&paper task. 


## Helpful?
The tests and provided functions were helpful as always.


## Duration (hours)?

_Please make a list where every student in your group puts in the hours they used to do the complete exercise_
_Example: [5.5, 4, 7], if one of you took 5 and a half hours, one person 4 and the other 7. The order does not matter._
_This feedback will help us analyze which exercise sheets are too time-intensive._
